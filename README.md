# Frontend

I'm aiming to build a full-stack chat application utilizing React (with redux), Typescript, NodeJS, Redis and websockets.
This repo contains all the frontend components. 

This is the design I came up with, for reference:
[FIGMA DESIGN](https://www.figma.com/file/1rgWVaiH3xtFNrNc32CwAK/VentSomething?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=Dut0sOhOnggU6nbx-1)

Notably, it's completely resizable and mobile friendly. 

# Live deployment

# TODO

- Mobile friendly version of the chat page
- Everything else is done, just got to connect it with the backend and deploy

## How to run

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
